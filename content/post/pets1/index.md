Horchata is the newest addition to my family.  We got her on August 10th, 2020  from a fmaily who had to give her up because they were moving.  We had been searching on PetFinder for a couple weeks at that point and had our eye on a Yorkie named Max.  But when I got the email saying we were selected to adopt "Izzy", we were over the moon to go meet our newest baby girl.  Hotchata had a rough start at her new home between missing her previous family and the Derecho that came through the Midwest, but she settled into her forever home quickly in the following weeks.  We know her now to be a cuddly little pup who is well behaved (most of the time) and will run after your hand for pets.

As you can see from the picture below, she likes to snuggle up on your lap and especially when she can be under a blanket too!  From what we've read, this is real common for small dogs like Chihuahuas.  She's about three years old currently, so she'll be in the family for the next decade or so!  When she isn't under the blanket or snuggled up in bed (... our bed ...), she can be found looking out the window from the top of the couch or poking around the kitchen looking for little treats left behind from dinner.

Her favorite activities include: playing with her duck and monkey toys; chasing squirrels, but just to make friends; and attempting to hide her bone in various locations around the house.  Cha-Cha is a great friend and companion to me, my partner, and our piggies too!

Cassiopeia is the second Guinea Pig to join my small petting zoo (I really should start a petting zoo after COVID.  It will supplement my grad student income nicely).  She is an American breed Guinea Pig that I got in Spring 2018 while I was still in Wisconsin at Lawrence.  I would descibe Cassie as the "Alpha" of the house.  She rules the land in tyranny, but is amenable to treats and hiding in your hair on occasion.  From the picture below, she often reads over my shoulder, learning as much as she can so that one day, it will be her who is in charge of us.

Cassie is a slipperly little one who is talented at escaping your grasp.  She is descibed as "aerodynamic" and "cunning".  She has been known to jump on top of her house in an effort to escape her habitat, and this is why I had to splurge on the tops to the cages I had purchased.  Although we haven't always seen eye to eye, she has mellowed out greatly in the couples of years I've had her.

Last but not least, we have Speckle, the Abyssinian Guinea Pig.  The OG piggy (well only if you discount the one I had as a kid, but was he really mine or my parents?  I sure didn't clean the cage).  Speckle and I have been BFFs since Fall 2017.  She has so many unique character traits and I love each and every one of them.  She's the "lazy" one who likes to lay down while she munches on hay, but in my mind, she's thinking about a piggy paradise in the middle of an open field(am I describing Kansas? Maybe Nebraska...).  

Here are her interesting behaviors: eating hair because she thinks it's hay; pretending to give you kisses before chomping on your nose; all of the popcorning; and on the a rare ocassion, she will chirp like a bird (I didn't believe it, but apparently Guinea Pigs can make some really neat sounds).

All three of my little girls have a special place in my heart.  My life would be very different without them.  It really helps to have soemthing that relies on you to live.  Helps you get up in the morning when all you want to do is lay in bed and forgot all of the radiative processes you had to remember for your final.  Alas, there is no rest for the weary.  The other thing I will say about having pets is that they are great for show and tell and can really brighten up someone's day.
