abstract = "The large-scale distribution of globular clusters in the central region of the Coma cluster of galaxies is derived through the analysis of Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys data. Data from three different HST observing programs are combined in order to obtain a full surface density map of globular clusters in the core of Coma. A total of 22,426 Globular cluster candidates were selected through a detailed morphological inspection and the analysis of their magnitude and colors in two wavebands, F475W (Sloan g) and F814W (I). The spatial distribution of globular clusters defines three main overdensities in Coma that can be associated with NGC 4889, NGC 4874, and IC 4051 but have spatial scales five to six times larger than individual galaxies. The highest surface density of globular clusters in Coma is spatially coincidental with NGC 4889. The most extended overdensity of globular clusters is associated with NGC 4874. Intracluster globular clusters also form clear bridges between Coma galaxies. Red globular clusters, which agglomerate around the center of the three main subgroups, reach higher surface densities than blue ones." abstract_short = "The large scale distribution of globular clusters in the central region of the Coma cluster of galaxies is derived through the analysis of Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys data.
