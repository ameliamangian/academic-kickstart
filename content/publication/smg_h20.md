abstract = "Water (H$_2$O), one of the most ubiquitous molecules in the universe, has bright millimeter-wave emission lines that are easily observed at high redshift with the current generation of instruments. The low-excitation transition of H$_2$O, $p$ - H$_2$O(2$_{0,2}$-1$_{1,1}$) (ν rest = 987.927 GHz), is known to trace the far-infrared (FIR) radiation field independent of the presence of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) over many orders of magnitude in FIR luminosity $L_{FIR}$. This indicates that this transition arises mainly due to star formation. In this paper, we present spatially ($\\sim$0.″5 corresponding to $\\sim$ 1 kiloparsec) and spectrally resolved ($\\sim 100$ kms$^{-1}$) observations of $p$ - H$_2$O(2$_{0,2}$-1$_{1,1}$) in a sample of four strong gravitationally lensed high-redshift galaxies with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. In addition to increasing the sample of luminous ($>10^{12} L_{\\odot}$) galaxies observed with H$_2$O, this paper examines the L_{H_{2}O}/L_{FIR} relation on resolved scales for the first time at high redshift. We find that $L_{H_{2}O} is correlated with $L_{FIR}$ on both global and resolved kiloparsec scales within the galaxy in starbursts and AGN with average $L_{H_{2}O}/L_{FIR} = {2.76}_{-1.21}^{+2.15} \\times {10}-5$. We find that the scatter in the observed $L_{H_{2}O}/L_{FIR}$ relation does not obviously correlate with the effective temperature of the dust spectral energy distribution or the molecular gas surface density. This is a first step in developing $p$ - H$_2$O(2$_{0,2}$-1$_{1,1}$) as a resolved star formation rate calibrator."
