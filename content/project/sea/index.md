Since Spring of 2019, I am the chair of the Society for Equity in Astronomy at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).  Previously, I was a part of the group working on undergraduate engagement.  Since taking over as chair, we have made strides in bringing awareness of inequalities to the faculty and supporting students from various backgrounds in their journey through the astronomy department at UIUC.  Our most impactful programs are the Astronomy Cultural Journal Clubs (ACJC) and our mentorship program.  We also host career development panels and workshops, and co-sponsor events with other campus organizations across disciplines. 

ACJCs are monthly meetings where we have an hour discussion on a topic related to improving the state of affairs in astronomy and academia.  Our latests topics have included: #blackintheivory; families in academia; TMT at Mauna Kea; and Starlink.  We select articles to use as starting points for brainstorming actionalbe items for the department to work on our diversity, equity, and inclusion.  Through ACJC, we have changed a bathroom in the department to all-gender, addressed concerns about the financial barrier of the GRE and how it is unindicitive of success in our program.  We have also started a tutoring program in Fall 2020 to address differences in students educational backgrounds.

Our mentoring program has nearly doubled this year with 43 people now involved.  This program matches undergraduate students to graduate students and post-docs to give young students a point of contact for all things academic, career, or personal.  Beginning this year, we will be gathering data to better understand how our program benefits students, and how we might be able to better serve our majors. I am the mentor of three students, currently, two sophomores and a freshman.

Other miscellaneous activities include graduate school panels, introductory coding workshops, diversity and outreach teas with visiting speakers, and a retreat which we co-sponsor with the Women and Gender Minorities in Physics and Astronomy.
