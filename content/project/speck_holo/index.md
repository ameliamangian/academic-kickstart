The galactic center is home to a supermassive black hole (SMBH) four million times the mass of the Sun.  How do we know this?  Point a really big telescope at the galactic center and watch the stars for a couple of decades.  That's what the UCLA team lead by Nobel Laureate Andrea Ghez did with the Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea.  She used ground breaking techniques to stack images, reducing the atmosphereic distortions, allowing for observations of very short period stars.  This lead to confirmation that our galaxy, indeed, is home to a SMBH.

Over the years since this project began, the imaging techniques have improved tremedously.  Technology gave us adaptive optics (AO), but there was a wealth of speckle imaging data (short exposure images used to beat turbulence in the atmosphere) that could extend the time baseline of stellar orbits.  Schoedel et al (2013) presented the speckle holography technique for crowded fields, which led to improved sensitivity in the speckle images.  Again in 2020, Chen et al presented speckle holography version 2_2 (Fig 1 in the paper shown above).  This new version improved sensitivity again, leading to a high rate of detection of the near-infrared counterpart to the SMBH.

I worked with version 2_2 doing studies of the improvements over version 2_1 of the speckle holography.  I investigated all 27 epochs of speckle data looking at the limiting magnitudes of the compostie images, the number of detected stars, and the astrometric uncertainties of the stars.  The extended time baseline will help future studies of SgrA* variability and tests of general relativity in a strong gravitational field.
