Starting in the Fall 2020 semester, the astronomy department at UIUC has started a tutoring program aimed at preparing students in math and physics prior to beginning astronomy courses.  The aim is to help even the playing field for students coming into the major who may not have had the same educational opportunities in high school.  The current tutors are Cail Daley, Cassidy Wagner, Kedar Phadke, and myself.  

Our focus is on introductory math and physics courses, particulary MATH 112 (College Algebra), MATH 115 (Pre-Calculus) and PHYS 100 (Thinking about Physics).  Math and physics often act as a barrier to entry for students who want to study astronomy.  By getting students on the right track early, we can help retain moreminority students who tend to be adversely impacted by large class sizes, testing methods, and a lack of support from peers and instructors.
